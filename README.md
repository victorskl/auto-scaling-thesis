# auto-scaling-thesis

### About

The thesis title "**Auto-scaling an optimisation algorithm using Docker and Kubernetes on the NeCTAR Research Cloud**" is written for my master's dissertation at The University of Melbourne. It is written in the context of a _Software Development Project_ track, hence, it is tutorial/experiment oriented record of the research work that had done. It will be useful for those who seek to learn Kubernetes in general and auto-scaling of containerised application.

You can read the thesis at [SanKhoLin_Autoscaling_Thesis.pdf](SanKhoLin_Autoscaling_Thesis.pdf).

### Citing as Unpublished Master's Thesis
