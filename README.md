### About

The thesis title "**Auto-scaling an optimisation algorithm using Docker and Kubernetes on the NeCTAR Research Cloud**" is written for my masters dissertation at The University of Melbourne. It is written for a _Software Development Project_ context, hence, it is tutorial/experiment-oriented record of the research work that has carried out. It will be good for those who like to learn Kubernetes cluster in general and auto-scaling of containerised application deployment.
