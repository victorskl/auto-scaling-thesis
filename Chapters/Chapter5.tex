The concept of \textit{Auto-Scaling system} is not new. The early research hypothesis dated back to IBM's \textbf{MAPE-K} model discussed in Autonomic Computing \parencite{1160055}. The paper identified the key autonomic elements  -- Monitor, Analyse, Plan, Execute, Knowledge -- the reference model for autonomic control loop for achieving the self-managed (self-optimisation, self-healing) autonomic computing system.
